Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-0836, CVE-2015-0831, CVE-2015-0827)

An information leak flaw was found in the way Thunderbird implemented
autocomplete forms. An attacker able to trick a user into specifying a
local file in the form could use this flaw to access the contents of that
file. (CVE-2015-0822)

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially crafted
HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Carsten Book, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jan de
Mooij, Liz Henry, Byron Campen, Tom Schuster, Ryan VanderMeulen, Paul
Bandha, Abhishek Arya, and Armin Razmdjou as the original reporters of
these issues.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Thunderbird 31.5.0. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 31.5.0, which corrects these issues.
After installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes
to take effect.
